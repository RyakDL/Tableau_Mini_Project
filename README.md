Project Overview: Downloaded full dataset from FDIC on Bank Failures from 2000 to 2023.
The project was more extensive in scope than our Project 3 which focused on the last 3 Recessions
and the 2 years periods surrounding those Recessions. 

The map displays the States and Cities that experienced at least 1 bank failure anytime from 2000 to 2023.
The overlay of the map is color coded to represent the Owner Occupied homeownership rates across each State.
Each circle represents a bank failure and the larger the circle the higher number of bank failures occurred in that area.
Visually, the map suggests that there is a correlation between higher owner occupied rates and higher number of bank failures 
in any given area. 

The circle chart represents that number of bank failures in any given year from 2000 to 2023. The visual trend appears to be that
the Great Recession that spanned from late 2007 to 2009 had a much longer trailing affect on the number of bank failures.
For example, the number of bank failures following the Great Recession in 2010, 2011 and 2012 far exceeded the number of bank failures
in any other year than 2009. 

Future work: 
Further work could be done to study the relationship between other demographics and the location and frequency of bank failures. 
For example, we were working on another chart that would have broken out the bank failures by Region (West, Central, East, South) and related 
bank failures to Census demographic data in those regions. Further work could be done to identify the total banking assets and or number of bank
locations for each bank failure and relating that to demographic data including per capita income by household data.
